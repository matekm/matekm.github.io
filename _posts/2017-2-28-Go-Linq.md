title: LINQ-like library for Go!
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

When I started coding in Go, one of the features I was missing was package that imitates IEnumerable LINQ-like extension methods from C#. For me, and probably for many other .NET programmers, those methods are extremely handy when working with collections. Mostly I use simple methods like **Where** to select elements or **Select** to map elements to other type, **First** to get first element that matches condition or **Any** and **All** to check if predicate is true for any/all elements.

So, in C#, to find a "red" color in collection of colors I would write following code:

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
 var colors = new[]{"red", "green", "blue", "orange"};
 colors.Where(c => c == "red");
{% endhighlight %}

to find and map it to other type I would write (assuming that I defined a Color type somewhere):

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
 var colors = new[]{"red", "green", "blue", "orange"};
 colors.Where(c => c == "red").Select(c => new Color(c));
{% endhighlight %}

In Go similar things were a bit harder for me. For most of the filtering tasks, I was using a code snipped I found on [stackoverflow]:

{% highlight go linenos %}
 func filter(ss []string, test func(string) bool) (output []string) {
     for _, s := range ss {
         if test(s) {
             output = append(output, s)
         }
     }
     return
 }

 colors := []string{"red", "green", "blue", "orange", "yellow"}
 filtered_colors := filter(colors, func(c string) bool { return c == "red"})
{% endhighlight %}

For mapping form one type to another I would have another function:

{% highlight go linenos %}
 func convert(ss []string) (output []Color) {
     for _, s := range ss {
         output = append(output, Color{s})
     }
     return
 }
{% endhighlight %}

With those two functions defined I would use them in following way to filter the colors and then convert it to target type:

{% highlight go linenos %}
 colors := []string{"red", "green", "blue", "orange", "yellow"}
 filtered_colors := filter(colors, func(c string) bool { return c == "red"})
 converted_colors := convert(filtered_colors)
{% endhighlight %}

It's good, but not perfect. First, it does not have function chaining - the feature I like very much in C# IEnumerable extension methods. Second, it generates a lot of code duplication between projects. That could be solved by creating a package for all those methods but usually, when I think about a problem that look like common problem, there are definitely people that solved it and shared their solution. So either I could write my own package or find a package that will suite my needs, possibly as closely imitating C# IEnumerable extension methods as possible!

Fortunately, the search was easy! 30 seconds of googling and I found [Go-Link] package. I quickly looked at the docs and decided that it looks good enough to test it in my projects. So, I downloaded it and tried!

With Go-Ling, the code that does the same thing as the code above looks like this:

{% highlight go linenos %}
 colors := []string{"red", "green", "blue", "orange", "yellow"}
 var converted_colors []Color;
 linq.From(colors).WhereT(func (c string) bool {
   return c == "red"
 }).SelectT(func (c string) Color {
   return Color{c}
 }).ToSlice(&converted_colors)
{% endhighlight %}

You can read a code like a book! The most important thing here (for me) is that I can chain the funcion calls and the functions signature are very similar to the ones in C# IEnumerable extension methods. The only things that worry me is the **ToSlice**, that I need to use to store the result in target slice. But it just how it needs to be done in Go (Or at least that what I think, but I'm just starting with Go!).

I'm still looking at the library and I'm testing it to see how usable it is when doing a little more complicated LINQ-stuff, but looking at the example in the documentation it is definitely worth trying. Pick it and test it in your project!
