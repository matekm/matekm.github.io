Hi! My name is Robert Matusewicz and I'm Software Engineer from Poland. Currently I'm employed by New Voice Media, a company that sell an advance ContactWorld solutions.

In my spare time, I trie to fix bugs in various open source projects, mainly Boost and .Net Core!

In this blog I plan to write about stuff I'm working on.
